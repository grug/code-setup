## Operating System

MacOS

### Apps

- [AutoMute](https://github.com/yonilevy/automute)
  - Automatically mutes my laptop when it goes to sleep or bluetooth disconnects. Saves those embarrassing moments where your headphones disconnect and your music starts blaring from your laptop speakers across the office.

## Editor

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Font

[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Ligatures enabled.

## Diagram Drawing

<https://excalidraw.com/>

I like Excalidraw because:

- No logins required.
- It's free.
- It has a no BS interface.
- Easy to export to SVG/PNG or to get a direct link to the diagram.
- Live sharing at the touch of a button (also doesn't require logins).

## Music

Spotify for streaming.

Bose QC35II for headphones.

## Microphone

Antlion Audio ModMic

This mic was recommended to me by a colleague and it's the perfect balance between great audio quality/capture and price.

## Screenshots

[Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch)

Skitch is a fantastic screenshotting tool. Easy keyboard shortcuts, easy to add annotations/arrows/blurring to a screenshot and then you can just drag the screenshot into somewhere like Slack or GitHub PR and it automatically uploads for you.

## Window Management

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)

The out-of-the-box setup is good enough for me!

## Shell

ZSH + [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) for my shell.

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for my terminal.

## Chrome Extensions

- [LGTM](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lgtm/oeacdmeoegfagkmiecjjikpfgebmalof?hl=en)
  - How else am I supposed to tell someone their code looks good to me?
- [Notion Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk?hl=en)
  - Saving sites straight to Notion is incredibly handy for easily curating reading lists.
- [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg/related?hl=en)
  - Easy way to view and edit cookies for a site. Really helpful for dev stuff.
  
 ## Note Taking
 
 [Notion](https://notion.so) - I think it's brilliant for taking notes and curating reading lists. The markdown support is also fantastic and it has a non-distracting UI.
